// An anagram is any word or phrase that uses the letters of a given ("subject") word or phrase in another, rearranged order. Write a function that creates an anagram list, listing all the rearrangements of a given word. For example, if the user types "east", the program should list all 24 permutations, including "eats", "etas", "teas", and non-words like "tsae".

// Hint: For your algorithm, you might want to think about a prefix and use that to create the new words. For example, given "east", use "e" as a prefix and place it in front of all 6 permutations of "ast" â€” "ast", "ats", "sat", "sta", "tas", and "tsa". This will give you the words "east", "eats", "esat", "esta", "etas", and "etsa". Continue this way until you find all the anagrams for "east". Then you can use "a" as a prefix and permute the remaining words "est". For "east", there should be 24 words.

// RECURSIVE, WORKS
const AnagramFinder = function (word) {
  let results = [];

  if (word.length === 1) {
    results.push(word);
    return results;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
    let firstChar = word[i];
    let charsLeft = word.substring(0, i) + word.substring(i + 1);
    let innerPermutations = AnagramFinder(charsLeft);

    for (let j = 0; j < innerPermutations.length; j++) {
      results.push(firstChar + innerPermutations[j]);
    }
  }

  return results;
};
