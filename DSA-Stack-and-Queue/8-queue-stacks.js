// There are many ways to implement a queue. You have learned using singly linked list, and doubly linked list. Keeping the concept of a queue in mind, implement a queue using 2 stacks and no other data structure. (You are not allowed to use a doubly linked list or array. Use your stack implementation with a linked list from above to solve this problem.)

// if you were waiting for everything to come in before you started addressing the items in the queue, then you just wait for the first stack to fill up then move everything to the second stack. This will reverse the order and now you can just start at the top.

// if you are addressing items as they come in without waiting, then it becomes a clusterf@%$ as you move the stacks back and forth ad nauseum
